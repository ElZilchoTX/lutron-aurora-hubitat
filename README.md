# lutron-aurora-hubitat

A driver to use Aurora Lutron Dimmers directly in Hubitat Elevation.

The main difference from the official driver is the ability to set the level, so when you turn the knob, no matter which device or automation changed the level before, it will continue from there.

You can also choose the behavior of the button, which can be set as a switch (turn the bulb on/off) or a push button, where you are free to use the click events to trigger any action you want.
